# Wine Quality Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project predicts wine quality using Logistic Regression based on physicochemical properties of wine.
It demonstrates the full machine Learning pipeline including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and classification.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify wine quality using different chemical attributes of wine.

Steps included:
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and transformation
- Training a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluating model performance
- Making predictions on new data

This project is useful for understanding classification problems using Logistic Regression.
